# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to the Python Practice Repository! This repository is designed to help you practice and master Python programming concepts, including basic syntax and fundamental data structures.

## Basic Syntax

Python's syntax is simple and easy to learn. Here are some key aspects to remember:

- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of curly braces.
- Comments: Use the `#` symbol to add comments for clarity and documentation.
- Variables: Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type explicitly.
- Control Flow: Python supports if-else statements, loops (for and while), and conditional expressions.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. You can add, remove, and modify elements in a list. Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
