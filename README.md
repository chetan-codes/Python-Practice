# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to the Python Practice Repository! This repository is designed to help you practice and master Python programming concepts, including basic syntax and fundamental data structures.

## Basic Syntax

Python's syntax is simple and easy to learn. Here are some key aspects to remember:

- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of curly braces.
- Comments: Use the `#` symbol to add comments for clarity and documentation.
- Variables: Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type explicitly.
- Control Flow: Python supports if-else statements, loops (for and while), and conditional expressions.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. You can add, remove, and modify elements in a list. Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Tuples
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items. Once created, you cannot change the elements in a tuple. Example:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a value. Example:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts
Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to define classes and create objects with attributes and methods. Here's a basic example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

#Create an object of the Person class
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
person1.greet()
```
